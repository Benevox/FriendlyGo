# FriendlyGo
The official repository for the FriendlyGo app.

FriendlyGo is an app that helps you meet new people in your area. There are three types of users: Friendees (1st users) who meet friends, Frienders (2nd users) who offer their friendship services, and Drivers (3rd users) who transport Frienders to Friendees. Friendees can customize friends based on skills, gender, and duration. Frienders set their skills and rates, while Drivers provide rides for Frienders to Friendees.

The App is Open Source and everything is available to the public.
